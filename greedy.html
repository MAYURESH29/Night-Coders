                <h3>Greedy : The Algorithm</h3>
                <p>A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.</p>
                <p>Greedy algorithms are simple and straightforward. They are shortsighted in their approach in the sense that they take decisions on the basis of information at hand without worrying about the effect these decisions may have in the future. They are easy to invent, easy to implement and most of the time quite efficient. Many problems cannot be solved correctly by greedy approach. Greedy algorithms are used to solve optimization problems</p>
                <h3>Algorithms follows Greedy strategy:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li style="color:White;font-weight: bold;">Activity Selection</li>
                    <p>Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
                        If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy</p>

                    <code>
                        1) Sort the activities according to their finishing time<br>
                        2) Select the first activity from the sorted array and print it.<br>
                        3) Do following for remaining activities in the sorted array.<br><br></code>

                    <li style="color:White;font-weight: bold;">Prims Algorithm</li>
                    <p>The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is simple, a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected. So the two disjoint subsets (discussed above) of vertices must be connected to make a Spanning Tree. And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a Minimum Spanning Tree.</p>

                    <code>1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.<br>
                        2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first.<br>
                        3) While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices<br>
                            a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.<br>
                            b) Include u to mstSet.<br>
                            c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as weight of u-v<br><br></code>

                    <li style="color:White;font-weight: bold;">Kruskal's Algorithm</li>
                    <p>Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree</p>
                    <code>1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
<br>
                        2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree<br>
                        formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.<br>

                        3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.<br><br></code>
